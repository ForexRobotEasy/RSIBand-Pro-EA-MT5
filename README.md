## Product Description

RSIBand Pro EA MT5 is an expert advisor for MetaTrader 5 platform that uses the RSI indicator and Bollinger Bands to generate trading signals. The EA is designed to trade on any currency pair and timeframe.

The main features of RSIBand Pro EA MT5 include:

1. RSI and Bollinger Bands: The EA calculates the RSI value using the Moving Averages library and checks if the RSI is above 70 or below 30. It also checks if the price is below the lower Bollinger Band or above the upper Bollinger Band.

2. Trade Management: The EA opens buy trades when the RSI is above 70 and the price is below the lower Bollinger Band. It opens sell trades when the RSI is below 30 and the price is above the upper Bollinger Band. The EA sets stop loss and take profit levels for each trade.

3. Trailing Stop: The EA has a trailing stop feature that can be enabled. It updates the stop loss level based on the current profit of the trade. If the current profit is greater than the trailing stop level, the stop loss level is adjusted to lock in the profit.

4. Input Parameters: The EA allows you to customize various input parameters including lot size, stop loss level, take profit level, maximum allowed spread, trailing stop level, and trailing stop step.
